# Copilot Fundamentals Training Exercises

## Introduction

### :warning: Note: The primary objective of this demo Repository is not to complete all the exercises. If you don't achieve the exact results by the end, that's perfectly fine! What matters most is that you gain insight into how to use Copilot effectively.

## Overview

Our goal is to **acquaint you with Copilot's functionalities** and demonstrate diverse ways to interact effectively with Copilot.

Copilot and Copilot Chat, while built on the same backend technology, serve distinct roles within your integrated development environment (IDE). To put it simply, **Copilot functions as a coding assistant**, responding to your in-code context, while **Copilot Chat operates as your research assistant**, enabling chat-based communication for more interactive collaboration with Copilot.

As these exercises leverage Copilot for code suggestions, please note that Copilot's responses may vary depending on the context. We welcome this variability, as it showcases the dynamic capabilities of Copilot.

For effective interaction with Copilot, it's essential to keep in mind that **Copilot benefits from your guidance and supervision!**
 
 To use copilot's own words,

## Issue Triage Policy

### Priority Levels

We use a four-level priority system to ensure consistent handling of issues:

| Priority | Description | Response Time Target |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **P0** | Critical - Service outage or security vulnerability affecting production | Immediate (< 1 hour) |
| **P1** | High - Major feature broken, significant user impact | Same day (< 8 hours) |
| **P2** | Medium - Feature partially broken, moderate user impact | Within 3 business days |
| **P3** | Low - Minor issue, cosmetic problem, or enhancement request | Best effort (2 weeks) |

### Severity to Priority Mapping

When triaging issues, use this default mapping as a starting point:

| Severity | Default Priority | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Critical | P0 | Production down, data loss, security breach |
| High | P1 | Major feature broken, performance degradation |
| Medium | P2 | Feature partially working, minor bugs |
| Low | P3 | UI polish, documentation updates, nice-to-haves |

**Note:** Priority can be adjusted based on business impact, number of affected users, and available workarounds.

### How to Triage in 60 Seconds

1. **Reproduce** - Can you confirm the issue exists?
2. **Severity** - How bad is it? (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. **Impact** - How many users are affected?
4. **Priority** - Use severity mapping + business context
5. **Label** - Add appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, etc.)
6. **Assign** - Route to the right team or keep unassigned for backlog
